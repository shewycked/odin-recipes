        <p>This is the popular recipe from the website AllRecipes.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Cornmeal</li>
            <li>All-Purpose Flour</li>
            <li>Sugar</li>
            <li>Kosher Salt</li>
            <li>Baking Powder</li>
            <li>Boiling Water</li>
            <li>Unsalted Butter</li>
            <li>Vegetable Oil</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine cornmeal, flour, sugar, salt, and baking powder in a bowl and whisk thoroughly until well mixed.</li>
            <li>Pour in water, and carefully mix with a spoon until combined. Add butter and mix with a spoon until combined.</li>
            <li>Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Use a spoon or ice cream scoop to transfer 8 equal portions onto the prepared pan. Cover with plastic and press with your hands to form smooth patties about 1-inch thick.</li>
            <li>For best results, chill dough in the refrigerator for at least 1 hour before frying. If needed, dough can be fried as soon as it is made.</li>
            <li>Heat oil in a deep fryer or large saucepan to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), or heat oil, 1/2-inch deep in a heavy skillet to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Deep fry cornbread in the preheated deep fryer (or pan-fry in the preheated skillet) until nicely browned, about 3 minutes per side. Let cool about 10 minutes before serving.</li>
        </ol>
